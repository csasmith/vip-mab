class Dec_UCB:
    ''' Create custom problem instances and run Dec_UCB on them

        Create a Dec_UCB instance with the desired parameters and call run() on the instance.

        Attributes
        ----------
        G: A NetworkX graph instance representing the network over which agents communicate.
            It is assumed each node already has a self-loop.
        T: The number of time steps the Dec_UCB algorithm will run for.
        opcode: Either 1 or 2. The opcode tells us which upper confidence bound function and weights
            we should use. 1 corresponds to Theorem 1 and 2 corresponds to Theorem 2.
        arm_means: An array of floats bounded on [0,1] that represent the mean reward value for an arm.
            In other words, the list of mu_k's.
        distributions: A N x M (N agents, M arms) array of fixed scipy.stats probability distributions
            where each distribution corresponds to an agent-arm pair. We could sample from the 0th arm 
            for the 0th agent as follows: distributions[0][0].rvs()
        N: The number of agents.
        M: The number of arms.
        neighbors: An array containing the set of all neighbors for each agent
        num_neighbors: An array containing the size of the neighbor set for each agent.

        distributions: A N x M (N agents, M arms) array of frozen scipy.stats probability distributions
